1. I approach designing software by first understanding what it is I plan to do by reading through documents, resources, and code that is similar to what I plan to do. Reading and seeing what I want to happen helps me because then I can make a plan and see beforehand some ideas of what works and what doesn't. For this project, I worked incrementally, just focusing on one aspect of the project at a time until I liked what I was seeing. This worked for the most part, but it would get tricky when different aspects of the project would collide with eachother and I would have to rework the code that I already created. Working this way has taught me that programming is fluid, and that my project is going to change a lot between the day I started it and the last day I work on it. 

Computer science will help me reach my goals because I really enjoy creating and working on things that will have a positive impact on our future. There are many different paths and roads you can take with computer science, and while graphics and visualization may not be for me, I find that it's important to have an understanding of all the different aspects of a larger computer program, since many include graphics.
